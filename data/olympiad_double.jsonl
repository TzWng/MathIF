However, due to the curved nature of the cowpaths that eventually became the streets of ARMLopolis, the distance $d(n)$ between house $n$ and City Hall is not simply the value of $n$. Instead, if $n=3^{k} n^{\\prime}$, where $k \\geq 0$ is an integer and $n^{\\prime}$ is an integer not divisible by 3 , then $d(n)=3^{-k}$. For example, $d(18)=1 / 9$ and $d(17)=1$. Notice that even though no houses have negative numbers, $d(n)$ is well-defined for negative values of $n$. For example, $d(-33)=1 / 3$ because $-33=3^{1} \\cdot-11$. By definition, $d(0)=0$. Following the dictum \"location, location, location,\" this Power Question will refer to \"houses\" and \"house numbers\" interchangeably.\n\nCuriously, the arrangement of the houses is such that the distance from house $n$ to house $m$, written $d(m, n)$, is simply $d(m-n)$. For example, $d(3,4)=d(-1)=1$ because $-1=3^{0} \\cdot-1$. In particular, if $m=n$, then $d(m, n)=0$.\n\n\nThe neighborhood of a house $n$, written $\\mathcal{N}(n)$, is the set of all houses that are the same distance from City Hall as $n$.
